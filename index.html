     <h3>About Katrina</h3>

     <p>I started teaching myself basic CSS and HTML about ten years ago. I never thought it was something that I would make a career out of. 
     More than anything I just wanted a new hobby. Since deciding that this is something that I want to do for a living I started the Engineering
     Flex program at Thinkful! With the help of this program I look forward to being able to make more interesting website designs and implementing
     javascript which is a whole new world to me!</p>
     <p>There's nothing that I love more than seeing what collaborating on code can come up with. I always end up learning something new when I work
     with new people and that's one thing that always makes me excited! Plus there's never anything wrong with having someone look over your code. 
     They might see something that you missed that could cause a problem later. </p>
     <p>Aside from writing code I have a deep love for music and television. I'm always looking for a new show to watch that will inevitably give me
     inspiration for the aesthetic of a new website.</p>
